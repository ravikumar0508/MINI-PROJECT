# MINI-PROJECT
ROCK ,SCISSOR, PAPER game using python

REQUIREMENTS:

*Python3

Modules Used:
Random

SMALL INTRO ABOUT MODULE:

Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string, etc.

Example: Printing a random value from a list

WHILE TRUE LOOP:

What is a while true loop in Python?
A while-loop executes code repeatedly as long as a given boolean condition evaluates to True . Using while True results in an infinite loop.



Is while true bad?
"while True" in itself is not bad practice/style, but using a "while True" loop in conjunction with a "break" could be considered bad practice because it can almost always be rewritten as a "while something" loop, which improves readability and maintainability.


Project Explanation:
The ultimate aim of this project is a paper scissor and rock game that what most of us play in small kids. by using loops ,if elif and else statements just by a simple program the game is run accordingly
